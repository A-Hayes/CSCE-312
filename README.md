# CSCE-312
Computer Organization

Course Decription: Computer systems from programmer's perspective including simple logic design, data representation and processor architecture, programming of processors, memory, control flow, input/output, and performance measurements; hands-on lab assignments. 

Notes: Useful for perspective on the base level of how computers function at a base level, to see what computers can and cannot do based on the extrapolation of logical gates. 

Run Info: All code can by run be the simplified virtual machine (labelled 'VMEmulator.bat' in the /Tools folder). .HDL files indicate simulated logic gates, .TST files compare own outputs with a provided output sheet. 

Usage Note: This repo is for display/reference purposes only. Do not use for your own coursework, cheating/plagirism will not be tolerated. If you are an instructor for this course and want to request that I take this repo down, please open a new Issue indicating such and I will comply promptly.
